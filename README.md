### Paraphrase generator
The program allows for simple paraphrasing of texts based on criteria selected in the user interface. Three text replacement methods are implemented (rhyme substitution, synonym replacement, expansion of description with additional adjectives). Each of these methods can be applied to the first, last, random, or every word in a line. The user can also adjust the accuracy and diversity of the changed words. The user can search for song lyrics or generate a random poem as the text to be paraphrased.

### Requirements
